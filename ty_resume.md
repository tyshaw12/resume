# Tyler Shaw
Senior computer science student at Brigham Young University Idaho. In my free time I like to play soccer, build computers, modify anything with a small engine, and play video games. I am looking for anything related to data so I can get a strong foundation with data before I eventually pursue a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and develop/train AI for the future.
